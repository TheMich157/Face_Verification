# Role Naming Guide

## Flexible Role Names
The bot supports friendly, readable role names. You can use:
- Spaces
- Special characters
- Capital letters
- Emojis

## Example Role Names

### Staff Roles
```
✅ "Senior Staff"
✅ "Staff Trainer"
✅ "Trained Staff"
✅ "Staff"
```

### Verification Roles
```
✅ "Verified 18+"
✅ "Verified 13+"
✅ "Awaiting Review"
✅ "Unverified"
✅ "Banned - Appeals"
```

## Alternative Names
The bot will recognize multiple variations of role names:

### 18+ Role Options
- "Verified 18+"
- "18+"
- "Adult"
- "18 Plus"
- "Verified Adult"

### 13+ Role Options
- "Verified 13+"
- "13+"
- "Teen"
- "13 Plus"
- "Verified Teen"

### Staff Role Options
- "Staff"
- "Mod"
- "Moderator"
- "Server Staff"

## How It Works
1. Bot looks for roles by any of the accepted names
2. Creates roles with friendly names if they don't exist
3. Updates references automatically if role names change
4. Maintains permissions regardless of name

## Best Practices
1. Use clear, descriptive names
2. Be consistent across server
3. Consider using emojis for visual clarity
4. Keep names professional
5. Avoid confusing abbreviations

## Example Setup
```
👑 Senior Staff
📋 Staff Trainer
✅ Trained Staff
🛡️ Staff
🔞 Verified 18+
✨ Verified 13+
⏳ Awaiting Review
👋 Unverified
📝 Appeals Only
```

## Notes
- Role functionality is not affected by name choice
- Permissions remain consistent regardless of name
- Bot commands work with any valid role name
- Role hierarchy is maintained automatically
- Role colors can be customized independently

Remember: Choose names that make sense for your server and community while maintaining professionalism and clarity.
